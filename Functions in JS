Hello Guys , in this File i have done some different Functions we use in JavaScript .
although there are many functions but i have mentioned here most used functions.

Hope this help you guys.

var stringone = "        I'm learning JavaScript all my by self     ";
var stringtwo = "want to be Front end developer" ;

//charAt() it tells the positing of the character 

console.log(stringone.charAt(1));

//charCodeAt() it tell us the unicode of a character

console.log(stringtwo.charCodeAt(3));

//concat() joins two or more strings together 

console.log(stringone.concat(stringtwo));

//endsWith() method determines whether a string ends with the characters of a specified string, returning true or false as appropriate.

console.log(stringone.endsWith("self")); // will get true cause at the end "self" is defined
console.log(stringtwo.endsWith("!")); // will get False since "!" is not there at the end 

//includes() tell us whether the given character is present or not

console.log(stringtwo.includes("front")); // will return true cause in string two "front" word is there

//indexOf() method returns the index within the calling String object of the first occurrence of the specified value,Returns -1 if the value is not found. 

console.log(stringone.indexOf("JavaScript"));

//repeat()method constructs and returns a new string which contains the specified number of copies of the string on which it was called, concatenated together.

console.log(stringtwo.repeat(2));

//search() method executes a search for a match between a regular expression and this String object.

console.log(stringtwo.search("end"));

//slice() method extracts a section of a string and returns it as a new string, without modifying the original string.

console.log(stringone.slice(4,8));

//split()  method splits a String object into an array of strings by separating the string into substrings, using a specified separator string to determine where to make each split.
console.log(stringtwo.split(" "));

//substring() works as same as slice , will produce same output

//toLowerCase() method returns the calling string value converted to lower case.

console.log(stringtwo.toLowerCase("front"));

//toUpperCase()  method returns the calling string value converted to uppercase

console.log(stringone.toUpperCase("self"));

//trim() method removes whitespace from both ends of a string.

console.log(stringone.trim());
